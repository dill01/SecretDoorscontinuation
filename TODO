- remind the player to close the door
- make signs, torches etc. placeable on the blocks
- find a good workaround for the double doors
- preserve block data (wool color, slab type, etc)
- restore the blocks if the door gets destroyed, or create drops for them
- Permissions. Yes, you "convinced" me that you really want and need it. So you shall get it.
- restrict certain block types (mostly containerblocks) to be usable as secret door only by left-clicking them
- add configuration support, so the admin can choose which blocks can actually be used as secret doors (e.g. bookshelves)
- possibly add LWC-support
